     <h1>About Me</h1>
     <p>
        Novanda Kensela Putra is a recent graduate from ISSTS in Surabaya, 
        passionate about exploring new horizons in both professional and personal spheres. 
        Beyond academic pursuits, Novanda finds joy in rhythmic beats as an avid drummer, 
        channeling creativity and focus into music. 
        Complementing this artistic passion, 
        Novanda maintains a disciplined regimen at the gym, 
        valuing the balance between physical health and mental well-being. 
        When not immersed in rhythmic cadences or physical exertion, Novanda finds solace in the digital realm, 
        where strategic challenges in gaming provide both entertainment and mental stimulation. 
        With a diverse range of interests and a thirst for continuous growth, Novanda approaches every endeavor with enthusiasm and dedication.
